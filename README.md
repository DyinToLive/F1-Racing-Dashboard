# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



React project by Jameson Watson

-Credit goes to the use of the components of ant design that made learning react a pleasure. Also credit to tailwind for css.

-Building this project I aimed to learn good React practices, implentation of different components using ant design, and styling components using TailwindCSS.

-Implented using Vite for building, and render + Github for hosting.

-The fetches in this project are done using supabase/supabase-js. Connected to a supabase Postgres DB that we built for our Node project.
